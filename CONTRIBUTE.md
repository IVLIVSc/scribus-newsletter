## Translation

We want each issue of the newsletter to be translated in as many languages as possible.

If you want to start a translation:

- If you're used to working with Github, fork this repository and create a new branch for this issue. Otherwise simply go to the files listed below and download them.
- Go to the the directory with the issue you want to translate (currently <https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter/tree/master/content/2015-10>)
- Create a file with your language code: 2015-10-itIt.md (the language code is composed by the language and the place, in this case italian as spoken in Italy)
- Translate the newsletter by trying to keep the markdown formatting.
- If you've forked the repository, make a pull request and we will be able to integrate your changes. Otherwise, simply send us the file by email or by adding it to the (issue tracker](https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter/issues).
