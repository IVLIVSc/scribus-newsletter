## About this newsletter

This is a Scribus newsletter published by contributors from the Scribus community.
Our goal is to produce one issue per month presenting different aspects of the life in the Scribus community.

TODO: complete the contributors list  
The  December issue has been written by Ale and Kunda.  

You can contribute through our Github repository <https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter> or by getting in touch with us in any way you see fit ([forum](http://forums.scribus.net), [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=scribus), [mailing list](http://lists.scribus.net), [twitter](https://twitter.com/scribus), email, ...)

Currently we are looking for more redactors, translators, and a graphic designer who proposes a nice HTML style for this newsletter.  
We would also like to see designers create a PDF version of each issue.

You can also ask us to cover specific topics, by commenting on the [ticket for the next issue](https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter/issues/21)).
